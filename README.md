2. Unzip file

## Changing the default keyboard shortcuts
1. Open Sketch's plugins folder. You can do this by right clicking the plugin in plugin manager (Plugins -> Manage Plugins...) and clicking "Reveal in Finder"
2. Open plugin's config file. To do this, right click on the plugin in Finder, select "Show Package Contents", then navigate to "manifest.json" within the "Contents" and "Sketch" subfolders.
3. Look for the word "shortcut" within the file. Should be self-explanatory from there. Good luck! :)
